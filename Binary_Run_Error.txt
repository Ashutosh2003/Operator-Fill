In some Linux distros or some particular versions of soime linux distros you may get the following error after attempting to run the .out file after successful compilation:

/build/gcc/src/gcc-build/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/libstdc++-v3/include/bits/basic_string.h:1058: std::__cxx11::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::reference std::__cxx11::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::operator[](std::__cxx11::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::size_type) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits<char>; _Alloc = std::allocator<char>; std::__cxx11::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::reference = char&; std::__cxx11::basic_string<_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc>::size_type = long unsigned int]: Assertion '__pos <= size()' failed.
[1]    4451 IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./{Filename}.out

Well for me this showed up out of nowhere after a system upgrade of Arch Linux (pacman -Syu). It was working all right in windows and in Arch too. Folks at Stackoverflow say that its due to pointer accesing invalid index of a string. But I cant debug 700 Lines now to find out the source of the problem :) . Maybe someday in the Future.

Solution
While compiling using g++ add the -O2 flag
Ex: g++ Fill.cpp -O2

This will "optimize" the compiler to not throw the above error.
